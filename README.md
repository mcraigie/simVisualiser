# simVisualiser - Healthhack 2015 Melbourne

simVisualiser is a tool for displaying and interacting with Social Identity Maps.
These maps are interpreted from .JSON files.

simVisualiser uses CherryPy and D3 to achieve to create the visualisation.

The D3 code would not have been possible without the examples provided online by Mike Bostock.

You can see a demo here:
https://mcraigie.github.io/simVisualiser/

Start the webserver:
python main.py

You will need to reconfigure CherryPy to use your own interface.
